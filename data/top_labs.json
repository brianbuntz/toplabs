The company's development of the Transformer architecture and BERT was highly influential in natural language processing, paving the way for the emergence of the current surge of interest in AI. The company's Google DeepMind subsidiary is among the most influential AI labs in the world, and has achieved groundbreaking milestones such as AlphaFold, which solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem, and AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion Go player. Alphabet's contributions to machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision remain influential across multiple domains. Alphabet's open-sourcing of TensorFlow has democratized access to AI tools, fostering a global community of researchers and developers. Furthermore, Alphabet's achievements in quantum computing, healthcare AI, autonomous vehicles, and Google Assistant demonstrate the company's commitment to applying research to real-world problems. Another pillar of Alphabet's AI strategy is its investment in specialized hardware, notably Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Beyond technology, Alphabet leads in establishing ethical AI frameworks, shaping industry standards for responsible development and deployment. In 2023, Alphabet ranked 8th in the Patent 300 list with 2,579 patents granted, showing a 23% increase from the previous year.",
