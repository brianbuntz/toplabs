    "description": "Since 1958, NASA has led the United States' journey into the cosmos. From studying our planet's atmosphere to sending rovers to Mars, the agency tackles air and space research across numerous scientific disciplines. At centers like Ames and JPL, NASA engineers develop new technologies for air and space travel, while scientists unravel the mysteries of the universe. Their current work includes sending humans back to the Moon with the Artemis program and searching for signs of past life on Mars.",
